Brief of the game:

Bomberman appears in the frame of the game when the code is run. There is also an enemy defeating whom is the goal of the game.
Bomberman can drop bombs to destroy the enemy. There are walls and bricks in the playing area which cannot be crossed by the bomberman.
However bricks can be destroyed by the bomberman with bombs.
The bomb explodes after pressing 3 keys(not necessarily functional ones).
Bomberman loses a life when killed by the enemy and also when caught in the bomb blast. If 3 lives are lost, the game is terminated.
Destroying a brick gives 20 points and an enemy 100 points.
